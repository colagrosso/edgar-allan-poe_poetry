					<p>The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at least. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared suddenly in the heavens⁠—attained, in a few days, a brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter⁠—then as suddenly disappeared, and has never been seen since.</p>
					<p>“Al Aaraaf” first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however, this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in⁠—all subsequent collections:</p>

							<span>Mysterious star!</span>

							<span>Thou wert my dream</span>

							<span>All a long summer night⁠—</span>

							<br/>

							<br/>
							<span>Yet all the beauty⁠—all the flowers</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That list our love or deck our bowers</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In dreamy gardens, where do lie</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Dreamy maidens all the day;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>While the silver winds of Circassy</span>
							<br/>
							<span>On violet couches faint away.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Little⁠—oh! little dwells in thee</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Like unto what on earth we see:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Beauty’s eye is here the bluest</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In the falsest and untruest⁠—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>On the sweetest air doth float</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The most sad and solemn note⁠—</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>If with thee be broken hearts,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Joy so peacefully departs,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That its echo still doth dwell,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Like the murmur in the shell.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Thou! thy truest type of grief</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Is the gently falling leaf⁠—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Thou! thy framing is so holy</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Sorrow is not melancholy.</span>

					<p>“The Raven” was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New York “Evening Mirror”⁠—a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N. P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second number of the “American Review,” the following remarkable poem by Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the “American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by Poe himself.</p>
					<p>[“The following lines from a correspondent⁠—besides the deep, quaint strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the author⁠—appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic: feet, we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in the verse” (stanza?)⁠—“which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were better understood.”⁠—Ed. “Am. <abbr>Rev.</abbr>”] <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-34" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject, and some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s friend, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem, headed it, “The Bells, By <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the editor’s property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:</p>

					<p>In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version, was sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union Magazine.” <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-38" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-42" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
