			<h2 epub:type="title">The City in the Sea</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! Death has reared himself a throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a strange city lying alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far down within the dim West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have gone to their eternal rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There shrines and palaces and towers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resemble nothing that is ours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around, by lifting winds forgot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resignedly beneath the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The melancholy waters lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No rays from the holy heaven come down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the long night-time of that town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But light from out the lurid sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streams up the turrets silently—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of scultured ivy and stone flowers—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up many and many a marvellous shrine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose wreathed friezes intertwine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The viol, the violet, and the vine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Resignedly beneath the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The melancholy waters lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So blend the turrets and shadows there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all seem pendulous in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While from a proud tower in the town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death looks gigantically down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There open fanes and gaping graves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yawn level with the luminous waves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not the riches there that lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each idol’s diamond eye—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the gaily-jewelled dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tempt the waters from their bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For no ripples curl, alas!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along that wilderness of glass—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No swellings tell that winds may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon some far-off happier sea—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No heavings hint that winds have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On seas less hideously serene.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lo, a stir is in the air!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wave—there is a movement there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if the towers had thrown aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In slightly sinking, the dull tide—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if their tops had feebly given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A void within the filmy Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves have now a redder glow—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hours are breathing faint and low—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when, amid no earthly moans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, down that town shall settle hence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall do it reverence.</span>

			<p>
				<span>At midnight in the month of June,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I stand beneath the mystic moon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exhales from out her golden rim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, softly dripping, drop by drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the quiet mountain top.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steals drowsily and musically</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the univeral valley.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rosemary nods upon the grave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lily lolls upon the wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapping the fog about its breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ruin moulders into rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking like Lethe, see! the lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A conscious slumber seems to take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would not, for the world, awake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Her easement open to the skies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Irene, with her Destinies!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, lady bright! can it be right—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This window open to the night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughingly through the lattice drop—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flit through thy chamber in and out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wave the curtain canopy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fitfully—so fearfully—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the closed and fringed lid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Neath which thy slumb’ring sould lies hid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That o’er the floor and down the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, lady dear, hast thous no fear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why and what art thou dreaming here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wonder to these garden trees!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange, above all, thy length of tress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this all solemn silentness!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is enduring, so be deep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaven have her in its sacred keep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This chamber changed for one more holy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This bed for one more melancholy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray to God that she may lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forever with unopened eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As it is lasting, so be deep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soft may the worms about her creep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the forest, dim and old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her may some tall vault unfold—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some vault that oft hath flung its black</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winged pannels fluttering back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Triumphant, o’er the crested palls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her grand family funerals—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some sepulchre, remote, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against whose portal she hath thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In childhood, many an idle stone—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some tomb fromout whose sounding door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She ne’er shall force an echo more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was the dead who groaned within.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Raven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></h2>
			<p>
				<span>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Only this, and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Nameless here for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">This it is, and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I scarce was sure I heard you “—here I opened wide the door;——</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Darkness there and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Merely this, and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Of “Never—nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3"><em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there—<em>is</em> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span>

				<span>Not long ago, the writer of these lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mad pride of intellectuality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maintained “the power of words”—denied that ever</span>

				<span>Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:</span>

				<span>Two words-two foreign soft dissyllables—</span>

				<span>The skies they were ashen and sober;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The leaves they were crisped and sere—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The leaves they were withering and sere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was night in the lonesome October</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of my most immemorial year:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the misty mid region of Weir:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here once, through an alley Titanic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were days when my heart was volcanic</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the scoriac rivers that roll—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the lavas that restlessly roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the ultimate climes of the Pole—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the realms of the Boreal Pole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our talk had been serious and sober,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Our memories were treacherous and sere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we knew not the month was October,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And we marked not the night of the year—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We noted not the dim lake of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">(Though once we had journeyed down here)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now, as the night was senescent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And star-dials pointed to morn—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the star-dials hinted of morn—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the end of our path a liquescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And nebulous lustre was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of which a miraculous crescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Arose with a duplicate horn—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Distinct with its duplicate horn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I said—“She is warmer than Dian:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She rolls through an ether of sighs—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She revels in a region of sighs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She has seen that the tears are not dry on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">These cheeks, where the worm never dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And has come past the stars of the Lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To point us the path to the skies—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the Lethean peace of the skies—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come up, in despite of the Lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To shine on us with her bright eyes—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come up, through the lair of the Lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With love in her luminous eyes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Psyche, uplifting her finger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her pallor I strangely mistrust—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, hasten!—ah, let us not linger!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Ah, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In terror she spoke; letting sink her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Wings till they trailed in the dust—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In agony sobbed, letting sink her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Plumes till they trailed in the dust—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Let us on, by this tremulous light!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Let us bathe in this crystalline light!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its Sybillic splendor is beaming</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With Hope and in Beauty to-night—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And be sure it will lead us aright—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We safely may trust to a gleaming</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That cannot but guide us aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And tempted her out of her gloom—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And conquered her scruples and gloom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we passed to the end of the vista—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But were stopped by the door of a tomb—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">By the door of a legended tomb:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On the door of this legended tomb?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">‘T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then my heart it grew ashen and sober</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the leaves that were crisped and sere—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the leaves that were withering and sere—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I cried—“It was surely October</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On <em>this</em> very night of last year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That I brought a dread burden down here—</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—</span>

			<p>
				<span>I saw thee once—once only—years ago:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must not say how many—but not many.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was a July midnight; and from out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the upturned faces of a thousand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gave out, in return for the love-light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Clad all in white, upon a violet bank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw thee half reclining; while the moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on thine own, upturn’d—alas, in sorrow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bade me pause before that garden-gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!—oh, God!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in an instant all things disappeared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The pearly lustre of the moon went out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mossy banks and the meandering paths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The happy flowers and the repining trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died in the arms of the adoring airs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only the divine light in thine eyes-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw but them—they were the world to me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw but them—saw only them for hours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw only them until the moon went down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How silently serene a sea of pride!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How daring an ambition; yet how deep-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fathomless a capacity for love!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would not go—they never yet have gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have not left me (as my hopes have) since;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They follow me—they lead me through the years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are my ministers—yet I their slave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their office is to illumine and enkindle—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My duty, to be saved by their bright light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And purified in their electric fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sanctified in their elysian fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sad, silent watches of my night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While even in the meridian glare of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see them still—two sweetly scintillant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!</span>

				<span>It was many and many a year ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In a kingdom by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a maiden lived whom you may know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">By the name of <b>Annabel Lee</b>;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this maiden she lived with no other thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Than to love and be loved by me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><i>I</i> was a child and <i>She</i> was a child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we loved with a love that was more than love—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I and my <b>Annabel Lee</b>—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a love that the wingéd seraphs of Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Coveted her and me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this was the reason that, long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wind blew out of a cloud by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Chilling my <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that her high-born kinsmen came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And bore her away from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shut her up, in a sepulchre</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Went envying her and me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And killing my <b>Annabel Lee</b>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of those who were older than we—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of many far wiser than we—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neither the angels in Heaven above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor the demons down under the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>:—</span>

			<p>
				<span>For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams</span>

				<span>And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i2">I am shorn of my strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no muscle I move</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As I lie at full length—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no matter!—I feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I am better at length.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I rest so composedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now, in my bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That any beholder</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Might fancy me dead—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might start at beholding me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thinking me dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The moaning and groaning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The sighing and sobbing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are quieted now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With that horrible throbbing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At heart:—ah, that horrible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Horrible throbbing!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sickness—the nausea—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The pitiless pain—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have ceased, with the fever</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That maddened my brain—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the fever called “Living”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That burned in my brain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And oh! of all tortures</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2"><i>That</i> torture the worst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has abated—the terrible</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Torture of thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the naphthaline river</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of Passion accurst:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have drank of a water</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That quenches all thirst:—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of a water that flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With a lullaby sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a spring but a very few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Feet under ground—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a cavern not very far</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Down under ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ah! let it never</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Be foolishly said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my room it is gloomy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And narrow my bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For man never slept</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In a different bed—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, to <i>sleep</i>, you must slumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In just such a bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My tantalized spirit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Here blandly reposes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetting, or never</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Regretting its roses—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its old agitations</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of myrtles and roses:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For now, while so quietly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Lying, it fancies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A holier odor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">About it, of pansies—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rosemary odor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Commingled with pansies—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rue and the beautiful</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Puritan pansies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so it lies happily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Bathing in many</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dream of the truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And the beauty of Annie—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drowned in a bath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the tresses of Annie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She tenderly kissed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She fondly caressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I fell gently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To sleep on her breast—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeply to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">From the heaven of her breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the light was extinguished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She covered me warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she prayed to the angels</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To keep me from harm—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the queen of the angels</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To shield me from harm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I lie so composedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now in my bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Knowing her love)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That you fancy me dead—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I rest so contentedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now in my bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(With her love at my breast)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That you fancy me dead—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you shudder to look at me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thinking me dead:—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But my heart it is brighter</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Than all of the many</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stars in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">For it sparkles with Annie—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It glows with the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the love of my Annie—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the thought of the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the eyes of my Annie.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The angels, whispering to one another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can find, among their burning terms of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">None so devotional as that of “Mother,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">You who are more than mother unto me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In setting my Virginia’s spirit free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother—my own mother, who died early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Was but the mother of myself; but you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And thus are dearer than the mother I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that infinity with which my wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.</span>
