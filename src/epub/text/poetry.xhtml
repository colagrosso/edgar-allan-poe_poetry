			<h2 epub:type="title">The Raven</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Only this, and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Nameless here for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">This it is, and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I scarce was sure I heard you “—here I opened wide the door;——</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Darkness there and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Merely this, and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Of “Never—nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3"><em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there—<em>is</em> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span>
